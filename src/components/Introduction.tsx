					In a time when Muslims are unable to unite, it is important to know
					what the majority of our Community has believed for over 1,400 years.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-4">
					Today we are overwhelmed with misinformation and bombarded by western ideologies; this
					causes confusion about our identity and beliefs. Many, if not most, who grow up under modern
					circumstances are not even aware of what to believe.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-4">
					The Aqida of Imam Tahawi (239-321 A.H.), also known as the Aqida of Ahl al-Sunnah wa&apos;l-Jamaa&apos;ah,
					represents the beliefs of the majority and is reproduced here so everyone has an easy
					way to reference what the beliefs of Sunni Muslims are (it can be said to represent the creed of both
					Asharis and Maturidis). A discussion on theology and doctrine is not the goal of this website. It&apos;s there, because
					sometimes we have to read, and re-read, so that that we can remember and continue to remind ourselves of what we believe in and how to live it.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-4">
					This text has been reproduced here from Book 1 (Beliefs) of Mawalana Shaykh Hisham Kabbani&apos;s (may Allah (ﷻ) grant him a higher station) <i>Encyclopedia of Islamic Doctrine</i> in the hope that it will be a useful resource for all Muslims. Shaykh
					Hisham says: <i>&quot;While the permanent relevance of the statements of belief in Al-Aqida is clear, the historical
						weight of the statements can be properly appreciated only if the work is studied with the guidance of some
						learned person.&quot;</i> Please keep this in mind when reading the text.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-4">
					May Allah (ﷻ) grant him a higher station and more blessings for his efforts in making this available
					to those of little understanding like us, may He bless Imam Tahawi for penning this Aqida, and may
					He grant us the ability to understand, unite, and live it.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-4">
					May Allah (ﷻ) forgive us for any mistakes, may He accept from us, and may He guide us all to the Straight Path.
